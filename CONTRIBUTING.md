# Contributing to MCP Local RAG

Contributions welcome! This guide covers what you need to get started.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 22
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shinpr/mcp-local-rag.git
cd mcp-local-rag
pnpm install
```

The embedding model (~90MB) downloads on first test/run.

## Quality Checks

All PRs must pass the full quality check, which mirrors CI:

```bash
pnpm run check:all
```

This runs the following in order:

| Step | Command | What it checks |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Biome check | `pnpm run check` | Lint + format combined |
| Lint | `pnpm run lint` | Code quality rules |
| Format | `pnpm run format:check` | Code formatting |
| Unused exports | `pnpm run check:unused` | No dead exports |
| Circular deps | `pnpm run check:deps` | No circular dependencies |
| Build | `pnpm run build` | TypeScript compilation |
| Test type check | `pnpm run type-check:test` | Strict TypeScript checking of tests |
| Test | `pnpm run test` | All tests pass |

Fix lint/format issues automatically:

```bash
pnpm run check:fix
```

## PR Requirements

Before submitting a pull request:

1. **Add tests** for new features and bug fixes
2. **Run `pnpm run check:all`** and ensure everything passes
3. **Update documentation** if behavior changes
4. **Keep commits focused** — one logical change per PR
5. **Enable "Allow edits from maintainers"** when opening your PR — this lets us push small fixes directly and speeds up the review cycle

## Changes to retrieval quality

Changes to parsing, chunking, embeddings, candidate selection or ranking can change
which evidence users receive. We accept these changes when their benefit justifies
the runtime and maintenance cost. An opt-in setting still needs that evidence.

Explain what improves, why the change should produce that improvement, and where
it could make results worse. Compare against the current implementation and any
simpler adjustment that could meet the same need. Keep the returned result count
or context budget fixed so that returning more text does not count as better
retrieval on its own.

Include enough evidence for someone else to check your conclusion:

- **Representative questions and justified answers.** Include ordinary semantic
  queries alongside the cases that motivated the change. Identify the relevant
  documents or answer passages and explain how those judgments were made.
- **Gains and losses.** Report per-query results and an appropriate aggregate
  measure, such as nDCG at the returned cutoff, with uncertainty across independent
  questions. Repeating one question does not create more independent evidence.
  Check whether useful evidence, conditions or exceptions disappear.
- **Cost under the same conditions.** Report retrieval latency and any affected
  memory, indexing or API costs. Explain why the chosen settings provide enough
  benefit for that cost.
- **A reproducible comparison.** Provide the corpus and query inputs, labels,
  source and model versions, settings, evaluation commands and individual results.
  Use shareable data when the original documents are private.

Match the evaluation to the claim. A focused regression case can establish a
specific extraction bug fix. A claim of generally better retrieval needs broader
evidence. Document relevance alone does not show that a returned chunk contains
the answer; a claim of better generated answers also needs an answer-quality
evaluation with a controlled generator and context budget.

We keep the existing behavior when the added value remains unclear. Evaluation
results inform the maintainers' decision about what the project will support.

## Writing tests

`vitest.config.mjs` runs with `isolate: false`, `pool: 'forks'`, `maxWorkers: 1` — required by `onnxruntime-node`, which keeps native state that vitest's per-file sandbox can't reset. The whole suite therefore shares one module registry.

This affects `vi.mock`. A top-level `vi.mock(path, factory)` registers globally and applies to every other test file that imports the same path — including files that use the real module.

Rule of thumb:

- If the mocked path is touched only in this file, top-level `vi.mock` is fine.
- Otherwise, scope the mock to this file with `vi.doMock` inside `beforeAll` and clear it in `afterAll`. Import the target dynamically after `doMock`, since `doMock` is not hoisted:

```ts
const parserFactory = () => ({ /* ... */ })
const MOCKED_PATHS = ['../../parser/index.js'] as const

let runIngest: typeof import('../../cli/ingest.js').runIngest

beforeAll(async () => {
  vi.resetModules()
  vi.doMock('../../parser/index.js', parserFactory)
  ;({ runIngest } = await import('../../cli/ingest.js'))
})

afterAll(() => {
  for (const p of MOCKED_PATHS) vi.doUnmock(p)
  vi.resetModules()
})
```

Live examples: `src/__tests__/cli/ingest-default-mode.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/server/handleIngestFile-side-effects.test.ts`.

## What We Look For

This project's development standards — testing strategy, error handling, code organization, etc. — are published as agent skills:

- Claude Code: [claude-code-workflows/skills](https://github.com/shinpr/claude-code-workflows/tree/main/skills)
- Codex CLI / other Agent Skills–compatible agents: [codex-workflows/.agents/skills](https://github.com/shinpr/codex-workflows/tree/main/.agents/skills)

We share this upfront so you know what to expect in review, not after. You don't need to memorize these — but referencing them (or developing with them loaded into your agent) makes implementation smoother, since review follows the same standards. If feedback feels unexpected, that's where it comes from.
